# module-5-challenge
I was asked to edit a workday calendar so that it could accept tasks and save them to local storage.

##  Project Description
I think I did this project right?? It seemed pretty simple! I was able to add a current day element that displayed the current day at the top of the page and then the rest was easy.

I was able to just duplicate the time blocks in the HTML and then use if and else statements to be able to display if the event has happened in the past, present or future. I also didn't want an alert to appear when you added a task so I just made it display at the top of the page instead. Overall seemed pretty easy and fun!
